## 2. Usage Instructions

### Country Cards Layout:
- The country cards are displayed in a **grid layout**. Depending on the screen size, the number of cards per row adjusts automatically:
  - On **large screens**: 3 cards per row.
  - On **medium screens**: 2 cards per row.
  - On **small screens**: 1 card per row.
- Each card shows a **country flag** and basic information like the country's **name**, **capital**, and **population**.

### Favorites Section:
- The **Favorites Section** is located at the **bottom of the screen** on mobile devices and stays in place while users scroll.
- On **desktop or tablet-sized screens**, it is positioned on the side of the screen.
- Users can click a **star button** on the country cards to add them to their favorites list.
- The Favorites Section will dynamically update with the countries the user has added.

### Popup for Country Details:
- When you click on any **country card**, a **popup** will appear displaying more detailed information about the country.
- Information might include: **Country name**, **Capital**, **Population**, **Flag**, **Languages**, and **Timezones**.
- You can **close the popup** by clicking on the close button.

### Data Fetching:
- The project fetches country data from the **Country Layer API**. This API provides up-to-date information about various countries such as name, capital, population, and more.
- If the API request fails or is unavailable, the project falls back to using a **local JSON file** as a backup data source.
- If data is missing or unavailable from either the API or the JSON file, it will display **"N/A"** in the respective fields.
